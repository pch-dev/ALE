                          Honesly, what did you expect? Your shameless betrayal has led you right where you are right now, and that's entirely your fault.

                          Your reward - a clear path to forgiveness and redemption, even though deep down you know you don't deserve it. Yet you should consider yourself lucky, as not everyone gains such privilege with so little effort.
